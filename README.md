# week-15-sequelizeBurger

Again, I mostly followed the instructions with this homework due to the second project starting this week.  I figure my time is better spent working on that since it has us using the same technologies and methods as this homework.

I have sucessfully replaced my custom ORM with Sequelize.  And also have it deployed and run succesfully to/on Heroku.


## Notes from week-14-burger

I mostly followed the homework instructions for this assignment due to time and the incoming project next week.  I did add a delete button for "throwing the wrapper away" for burgers that have been eatened already.  

### Some Notes
In the html/client side javascript, I didn't keep my backend api calls consistent because I wanted to get used to different methods to send/get data from the server.

Also, I claim that all misspellings on the page are totally there for comedy's sake.
