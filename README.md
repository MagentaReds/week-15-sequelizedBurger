# week-14-burger

I mostly followed the homework instructions for this assignment due to time and the incoming project next week.  I did add a delete button for "throwing the wrapper away" for burgers that have been eatened already.  

### Some Notes
In the html/client side javascript, I didn't keep my backend api calls consistent because I wanted to get used to different methods to send/get data from the server.

Also, I claim that all misspellings on the page are totally there for comedy's sake.
